Pointers :

The Pointer in C, is a variable that stores address of another variable.

A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable. Unlike other variables that hold values of a certain type, pointer holds the address of a variable. For example, an integer variable holds (or you can say stores) an integer value, however an integer pointer holds the address of a integer variable.



Points to remember:

1. whenever an application is in running state, then there is certain amount of memory consumption. (i.e. RAM consumption)
2. In c programming, our output is evaluated is in run time.

For eg: My program name is sum.c

 int a,b,sum.
printf.
scanf.
sum=a+b.
print sum.

If i run this code, sum.c is loaded in RAM.
a,b, sum are the variable which are declared and used inside the program.
So whenever a c program is in output state or running state, each and every
variable declaration will consume a memory. For eg:

In above case, a will consume 2/4 byte of RAM.
               b will consume 2/4 byte of RAM.
	       summ will also consume 2/4 byte of RAM.

From memory point of view:

Whenever a variable consumes a memory, it creates a placeholder of a certain nature.

For eg: int x=5.

A place in memory is created which is named x, and its value is 5, and x also has a certain address. Memory can be accessed through address as well.

There are always 3 things whenever we declare a data of any type.

for eg: float y=3.4;
	A place in memory is created which is named y, and its value is 3.4 and y has its own address which is 000X44486.



int a=5;

a variable is created in memory which has value 5. a also has its address as well, which can be 34345353



For reference : Take example of your house.
House is a place holder.
House keeps things inside it.
House has it own address.

We can identify our house by 2 ways:
1. By the name of the person living inside the room.
2. By house number.


Real implementation in c:

So by note, we learnt that:


A pointer is a variable, which hold address of another variable.

Normal variables:
How do we declare? : int a; float y; char x;
How do we assign value: int a=5; float y=1.5; char x='d';

Pointer variables:
How do we declare? int *a, float *y, char *x;


The significance of & symbol:

 we use & symbol in scanf();

for eg:

int a;   //we declared a variable named a, which can store integer value.
printf("Enter value of a");  // we printed a line in output console.
scanf("%d",&a);  

In 3rd line: 
	User enters a value and it is stored in the address defined for a.
which means, & symbol represents address of a variable. So by this logic
scanf() in above example means.

Compiler is grabbing input from user and placing it in address of a.

&a= address of a.


int a=5;

a=5. (If you write just variable name then that is value stored in the variable).
&a= If you write & variable name, that is address of that variable. 



How do we store address of a variable in a pointer?

Things to know:

If you are trying to use pointer to store address of a variable of a certain data type, then both the pointer and variable should be of same data type.


For eg:

int a=5;   //a is normal variable which has value 5, and lets suppose its address is 1000

a=5, for value format specifer is %d.
&a=1000, for address format specifier is %p.

printf("%d",a);  // output=5
printf("%p",&a); //output=1000.

int *p;  //here p is a pointer variable.

p=&a;  //here we assigned address of a in p.

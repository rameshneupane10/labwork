Here we will learn how pointers and array works:


definition of array:  Array is collection of data of similar data type.
	for eg: 
	int a[10]= a is an array which can store 10 numbers.
	int a= a is a variable which can store 1 number;


definition of pointer: Pointer is a variable but instead of value, it stores address of another variable/array.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can solve array and pointers in 2 ways.
1. By using array name itself as pointer. (Here we dont declare a pointer).
2. By using a pointer variable and relating with it an array.


1. By using array name itself as a pointer.

Golden rule: &x[i] is equivalent to x+i and x[i] is equivalent to *(x+i).
	Value print=x[100]=*(x+100);
	Value input=&x[98]= x+98;



Solution:

    Important concept to learn before learning pointers and array relation:

a. If there is array char char kist[3]={'a','b','c'};. Suppose the base address for kist array is 2000,which means the starting address of array kist is 2000. Since the starting of array kist has kist[0] index, the address for kist[0] is also 2000.

kist[0]= a,address=2000.
kist[1]= b,address=2001. (Here the address increased by 1,why?
Answer: Because the array kist is of char data type and in char data type it consume 1 byte.
kist[2]= c,address=2002.

b. double balance[50];
	Here balance array is created, of double data type which can store 50 values.
	first index: balance[0]
	last index:   balance[49]
	Imp thing:
		In above array, balance is a pointer to &balance[0], which is the address of the first element of the array balance. Thus, the following program fragment assigns p as the address of the first element of balance.

eg:
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

   /* an array with 5 elements */
   double balance[5] ;

   int i;

    printf("Enter 5 values");
	for(i=0;i<=4;i++)
	{
		scanf("%f",&balance[i]);	
	}

   printf( "Array values using balance as address\n");
	
   for ( i = 0; i < 5; i++ ) {
      printf("\n%f",balance[i]);
   }
 
   return 0;
}

If you are doing array and pointers program, but not declaring any pointers then
&x[1] is equivalent to x+1 and x[1] is equivalent to *(x+1).
&x[2] is equivalent to x+2 and x[2] is equivalent to *(x+2).
we can result:
&x[i] is equivalent to x+i and x[i] is equivalent to *(x+i).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In variable case:

int a=5;
int *p;
p=&a;

printf("By using variable=%d",a);
printf("By using  pointer=%d",*p);


In array case (without using pointer variable):

int a[5]={1,2,3,4,5};
/*       Here array name=a.
         array firstindex= a[0].Suppose a[0] has address=200, then a[4] address is 208
	 base address of array a=200.
	 starting address of array a=200. (Because, starting address,base address and          address of first index mean the same thing in an array)
	By definition learnt above, array name stores base address of array.
	so a=&a[0];
*/

printf("Normal array method=%d",a[1]);
printf("By using array name as pointer=%d",*(a+1));


Printf("Enter value at 4th index");//Normal scan in array
scanf("%d",&a[1]);


Printf("Enter value at 4th index");//scanning in array using array name as pointer.
scanf("%d",a+1);

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. By using a pointer variable and relating with it an array.

Things to know:

eg:

int a[5];

datatype=int.
size=5.
memory consumption=10 bytes.
starting/base address= a which is equivalent &a[0].


a. Program with normal array

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
	int a[5];
	int i=0;
	clrscr();
	printf("\n Enter elements of array:");
	for(i=0;i<=4;i++)
	{
		scanf("%d",&a[i]);
	}
	printf("\n The array list is:");
	for(i=0;i<=4;i++)
	{
		printf("%d\n",a[i]);
	}
getch();
}

b. Program with array as pointer.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
	int a[5];
	int i=0;
	clrscr();
	printf("\n Enter elements of array:");
	for(i=0;i<=4;i++)
	{
		scanf("%d",a+i);
	}
	printf("\n The array list is:");
	for(i=0;i<=4;i++)
	{
		printf("%d\n",*(a+i));
	}
getch();
}

b. Program with array and a pointer pointing to that array.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
	int a[5]; // Array name =a, base address of array= &a[0] or a.
	int *p;
	int i=0;
	p=&a[0]; //p=a;  (Both the statement does same thing i.e in both case base         address of array a is assigned to pointer p.)
	clrscr();
	printf("\n Enter elements of array:");
	for(i=0;i<=4;i++)
	{
		scanf("%d",p+i);
	}
	printf("\n The array list is:");
	for(i=0;i<=4;i++)
	{
		printf("%d\n",*(p+i));
	}
getch();
}


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pointers with one dimension array:


a.int a[10]; (Here array name is used as pointer)

scanf= a+i.
printf= *(a+i).


b. int a[10];
   int *p;
   p=a; or p=&a[0];
   scanf= p+i;
   printf=*(p+i);


Concept of "Pointer to an Array":


Background or revision of normal pointer and array:

//In any given array lets say int a[5], 5 is the number of items that array 'a' can store, int is that data which is going to be contained inside array 'a'.
And 'a' is name of that array as well as it also stores base address or starting address of array 'a'.
	/* We need to understand one thing here. &a[0] is base address or address of first element of array a ie. address of a[0] or starting address of array a.
	
a[3],p+3,which means in pointer if we add a number or integer beside that pointer name, then it represents index of array.

In one dimension array , while using pointer

scanf always deals with address= p+i  // &a[i]
printf always deals with value=*(p+i)  // a[i]

eg:
    int a[5]={1,2,3,4,5};
   int *p,i=0;
   p=&a[0]; or p=a;  
   for(i=0;i<=4;i++)
   {
	printf("\n Address of i index is %p",p+i);
   }

Output:
 Address of 0 index is 100
 Address of 1 index is 102
 Address of 2 index is 104
 Address of 3 index is 106
 Address of 4 index is 108



New concept: Pointer to an array.

  How do we declare pointer to an array:

 eg:


#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
	
	int *p; // If we do *p, then even though it points to an array, it points one element at a time.
	int (*ptr)[5]; //If we do (*p)[5], then it will point to whole array block at once.
	int arr[5];
	p = arr; //starting address of arr is assigned to p.
	ptr = &arr[0];//starting address of arr is assigned to ptr.  
	printf("p = %p, ptr = %p\n", p, ptr);
	p++; or p=p+1
	ptr++; or ptr=ptr+1
	printf("p = %p, ptr = %p\n", p, ptr);
	return 0;
}

Output:
p = 0x7fff4f32fd50, ptr = 0x7fff4f32fd50
p = 0x7fff4f32fd54, ptr = 0x7fff4f32fd64







  Here ptr is a pointer that can point to an array of 10 integers.

We need to learn, what is difference between *p, and (*ptr)[5]?

Ans: *p is a pointer which points to a variable at a time, when used with array, it will only point to a single index at a time.

But (*p)[5] is a pointer to whole array, it doesnt point 1 element but rather it points to whole array a time.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Final Conclusion:


In 1-D array, whenever we are using pointer,  use *p only.


scanf= (p+i);
printf= *(p+i);

eg:

int a[4];
int *p,j;
p=&a[0];   or p=a; //pointing



	for(j=0;j<=4;j++)
	{
		scanf("%d",(p+i));
	}


	for(j=0;j<=4;j++)
	{
		printf("%d",*(p+i));
	}

}




In 2-D array, whenever we are using pointer, never use *p.

Use (*p)[columnsize];

scanf= *(p+i)+j;
printf= *(*(p+i)+j);

eg:

int a[4][5];
int (*p)[5],i,j;
p=a; // pointing : dont use p=&a[0][0] in 2-D array case,only p=a will work.

for(i=0;i<=3;i++)
{
	for(j=0;j<=4;j++)
	{
		scanf("%d",*(p+i)+j);
	}
}

for(i=0;i<=3;i++)
{
	for(j=0;j<=4;j++)
	{
		scanf("%d",*(*(p+i)+j));
	}
printf("\n");
}



-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task for the day.

1. Do matrix multiplication ( using pointer and array together).

2. Practice all the program of arrays using pointer( Both using array as pointer and using pointer and array separately).

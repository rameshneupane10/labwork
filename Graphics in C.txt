Graphics in C:

graphics.h = library file.


what do you understand by term "device drivers" in computer?


Computer has input and output device.


Input:Keyboard,Mouse.
Output:Screen,Printer,Speaker.


Device Drivers:

We have input and output devices in our computer system.

 A driver, or device driver is basically a software, which is a set of files that tells a piece of hardware how to function by communicating with a computer's operating system.

Important initial 2 steps while doing graphics programming in C:

1. Always include grahics.h file in your code.
2. Always initailize drivers after starting main().



Skeleton Layout of graphics code in C:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<graphics.h>
#include<conio.h>


int main()
{
   int gd= DETECT, gm;   // label 1

   initgraph(&gd, &gm, "C:\\TURBOC3\\BGI"); //;label 2

	//These above 2 lines code are initializing device drivers and making drivers ready for the program.
       
		<Whatever code you want to write to display graphics>
	

   getch();
   closegraph();
   return 0;
}

Let us understand few terms used in skeleton program above:

label 1:
While initializing device drivers, we always should initialise two things which are
	a. Graphics Driver. (gd)
	b. Graphics Mode. (gm)

	Now,if we see above we can see we have set gd=DETECT.
	
	DETECT is a macro which when set helps to find graphics driver automatically.

label 2:
	we are intiailising graphics system.
	
syntax : 
initgraph(int *graphicsdriver,int *graphics mode, pathtodrive)  

BGI=Borland Graphics Interface.

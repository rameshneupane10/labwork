NULL pointers:

Pointer which doesnt point anywhere is known as NULL pointers. and NULL is a default value defined in C already.

Meaning of NULL= empty.


Let us see a program of pointer:

#include<stdio.h>



void main()
{
	int a=1; //base address=500. //No memory free
	int *p;
	p=&a; // p=500 //p=NULL
	if(p==NULL)
	{
		printf("\n Memory is not allocated");
	}
	else
	{
	
		printf("The value of a is %d", *p); //1
		printf("Address of a is %p",p); //500
	}	
getch();
}

output:

------------------------------------------

int a[20];
int *p;
p=a; //pointing

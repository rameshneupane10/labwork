Multidimensional Array:


How to declare one dimensional array?

Ans: int num[20];
     int a[10]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};


Why do we need multidimensional array?
Ans:
	If a matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns,then it is 2 X 3 matrix.
	2 is no of rows and 3 is no of columns

	If a matrix has 5 rows and 2 columns,then it is 5 X 2 matrix.
	5 is no of rows and 2 is no of columns.
	i.e in matrix, front value is no of rows and second value is no of columns.


	In order to solve matrix problems or problems of same nature we use
	multidimensional array.
	
How to declare multidimensinal array?
Ans:
	If we had to declare one dimensional array, we would do:
	int a[10], int num[20] and so on.
	But since we are declaring multidimensional array, we need to represent both rows and columns. Hence multidimensional array is declared in following way.

	int a[2][3]; int num[5][4];
	
	Hence, syntax for multidimensional array declaration is:

	<datatype> arrayname[rows][columns];


How to initialize multidimensional array? //static input

Ans: Intitializing means creating array or variable with already value in it.

	int a[4][3]= {{1,2,3},
		      {4,5,6}, 
                      {7,8,9},
                      {10,11,12}};


	int a[2][2]= { {1,2},
		       {3,4}}; 	

How to take input from user in multidimensional array or how to take dynamic input?

Points to remember from pattern program:
	How many loops if there is row and column? = 2
	While printing in pattern what is printed first? = row


Coding:   int a[10] : scanf("%d",&a[i][j]);

#
#
void main()
{
	int a[5][4],i=0,j=0;
	clrscr();
	printf("\nEnter the values");
	for(i=0;i<=4;i++) //this loop represents row and this loop block is to take input
	{
		for(j=0;j<=3;j++) //this loop represents column
		{
			printf("\n Enter [%d][%d] element",i,j);
			scanf("%d",&a[i][j]);
		}
	}
	for(i=0;i<=4;i++) //this loop represents row and this loop block is to print multidimensional array.
	{
		for(j=0;j<=3;j++) //this loop represents column
		{
			printf("%d",&a[i][j]);
		}
		printf("\n");
	}

getch();
}


Output:
Enter the values:
Enter [0][0] element: 1
Enter [0][1] element: 2
Enter [0][2] element: 3
Enter [0][3] element: 4
Enter [1][0] element: 5 and so on.


Homework: WAP to take two 4x3 matrix and print sum.
 (WAP to take two numbers and add them)


Ans:


Logic: a  (2x3)
		2 3 4 
		5 6 7 


    b  (2 x3)
	        1 2 3
		2 4 5
	
    sum (2x3)
		3 5 7
		7 10 12


While doing sum or diffrence of 2 matrix, the dimension of both matrix should be same, and the resulting matrix will be also of same dimension.

#
#
void main()
{
	int a[4][3],b[4][3],sum[4][3],i=0,j=0;
	clrscr();
	printf("\nEnter the values");
	for(i=0;i<=3;i++) //this loop represents row and this loop block is to take input
	{
		for(j=0;j<=2;j++) //this loop represents column
		{
			printf("\n Enter [%d][%d] element",i,j);
			scanf("%d",&a[i][j]);
		}
	}
	for(i=0;i<=3;i++) //this loop represents row and this loop block is to take input
	{
		for(j=0;j<=2;j++) //this loop represents column
		{
			printf("\n Enter [%d][%d] element",i,j);
			scanf("%d",&b[i][j]);
			sum[i][j]=a[i][j]+b[i][j];
		}
	}
	for(i=0;i<=3;i++) //this loop represents row and this loop block is to print multidimensional array.
	{
		for(j=0;j<=2;j++) //this loop represents column
		{
			printf("%d",sum[i][j]);
		}
		printf("\n");
	}

getch();
}



2. WAP to take two multidimensional array and print the product:

Ans:   


Logic: a  (2x3)
		2 3 4 
		5 6 7 


    b  (2 x3)
	        1 2 3
		2 4 5
	
    Product (2x3)
		2 6 12
		10 24 35
 
In product, the logic is not same as sum or difference.

Correct Logic for matrix multiplication:
lets suppose, a and b where a matrix has dimension mxn and b matrix has dimension oxp

a : mxn
b : oxp

Here axb is only possible when column of a is equal to row of b.
and bxa is only possible when column of b is equal to row of a


a : 5x3
b: 4x5

Is axb multiplication possible? ans: No, since column of a is 3 and row of b is 4.

a:5x3
b:3x7

Is axb multiplication possible? ans: Yes, because column of a is 3 and row of b is 3 which is equal.



axb ? ok , bxa? fail

a[2][4],b[4][5]

Resulting: Product[2][5];



a[6][9], b[3][6]

bxa
resulting matrix: product[3][9].


Code:

#include <stdio.h>
 
int main()
{
  int m=0, n=0, p=0, q=0, c=0, d=0, k=0, sum = 0;
  int first[10][10], second[10][10], multiply[10][10];
 
  printf("Enter number of rows and columns of first matrix\n");  //first matrix: m x n,second matrix: pxq
  scanf("%d%d", &m, &n);  //we are taking dimension for first matrix  m=3,n=4

  printf("Enter elements of first matrix\n");
 
  for (c = 0; c < m; c++)   // This double for loop is where first matrix is taking input.
  {
    for (d = 0; d < n; d++)
      {
	  scanf("%d", &first[c][d]);
      }
  }
	
 flag:
  printf("Enter number of rows and columns of second matrix\n");
  scanf("%d%d", &p, &q);   // we are taking dimension for second matrix  p=4,q=5

/* in this program we are trying to firstxsecond matrix, for which n should be equal to p.*/
 
  if (n != p)
   {
    printf("The multiplication isn't possible.Please try again\n");
    goto flag;
   }
	
 else
  {
    printf("Enter elements of second matrix\n");
 
    for (c = 0; c < p; c++)  //this part is taking input for second matrix.
      for (d = 0; d < q; d++)
        scanf("%d", &second[c][d]);
 
    for (c = 0; c < m; c++)   // This triple loop block is part where actual multiplication is taking place and value is being passed ont multiply matrix.
    {
      for (d = 0; d < q; d++) 
       {
        for (k = 0; k < p; k++) 
         {
          sum = sum + first[c][k]*second[k][d];
         }
         multiply[c][d] = sum;
         sum = 0;
       }
    }
 
    printf("Product of the matrices:\n"); 
 
    for (c = 0; c < m; c++)  //this part is to print multiply matrix.
     {
      for (d = 0; d < q; d++)
       {
        printf("%d\t", multiply[c][d]);
       }
      printf("\n");
     }
  }  //else scope ending
  
 
  return 0;
}

Recursion:
A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. And, this technique is known as recursion.

In simple terms, if there is a function call inside its own function definition,then it is called recursive function.

In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.

The C programming language supports recursion, i.e., a function to call itself. But while using recursion, programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.

Recursive functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.


Points to Remember in Recursive function:
1. There should be a function call inside function definiton.
2. The calling function should be same name of function definition.
3. THere should be an exit condition to stop recursion. If there is no any exit condition, then the whole process gets into a infinite loop.


Example: Sum of Natural Numbers Using Recursion


Natural Number: which starts from 1.

user: 500,400,123456

#include <stdio.h>
int sum(int n);

int main() {
    int number, result;

    printf("Enter a positive integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &number); //5

    result = sum(number);

    printf("sum = %d", result);
    return 0;
}

int sum(int n) {
    if (n != 0)
        // sum() function calls itself
        return n + sum(n-1); 
    else
        return n;
}


Fibonacci Series using recursion:

#include<stdio.h>
 
int Fibonacci(int);
 
int main()
{
   int n, i = 0, c;
 
   printf("How many terms do you want in your
		fibonacci series?"); 	 
  scanf("%d",&n);   //n=5
 
   printf("Fibonacci series\n"); 
 
   for ( c = 1 ; c <= n ; c++ )  //4
   {
      printf("%d\n", Fibonacci(i));
      i++;  //3
   }
 
   return 0;
}
 
int Fibonacci(int n)
{
   if ( n == 0 )
      return 0;
   else if ( n == 1 )
      return 1;
   else
      return ( Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)
);
} 

Output: 0,1,1,2,



# WAP to find the power of a given number using recursion.


#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>

int mansan(int,int); //Prototype or Declaration.

void main()
{

	int result=0,num=0,p=0;
	clrscr();
	printf("Enter the number and the exponential power value respectively");
	scanf("%d %d",&num,&p);
	result=mansan(num,p); (5,5) //call  (num,p)=Multiply num by itself, p times.
	printf("\n The result=%d",result); //8
	getch();
}


int mansan(int x, int y)   //Defintion (2,3)
{
	
	if(y!=0)
	{
		return(x * mansan(x,y-1));
	}
	else
		return 1;
}

Assignment: WAP to find the power of a given number using user defined function.
Assignment: WAP to find factorial of a given number using rescursion.



Sum of natural number: If number is 5 then it means, 1+2+3+4+5.

Factorial of a number: If number is 5, then it means 1*2*3*4*5.

Strings and characters:

How to define character?

eg:  char x; which is similar to int y;

If we do int y, then we are declaring a variable which is named y, which can store
1 number or integer.

If we do char x, then we are declaring a varibale which is named x, which can store
1 character.

How to initialize a character?
eg:

int y=5;

In this case, a variable y is declared and 5 is assigned as value.

char x=h; //this is wrong

char x='h';//this is right.

First case is wrong.

In second case, x variable is declared as character data type and stores h alphabet as value.

Format specifier:
int= %d
float= %f
char= %c

program:

WAP to take an alphabet as input and display

#
#
void main()
{
	char x='y';
	clrscr();
	/*printf("Enter an alphabet");
	scanf("%c",&x);*/
	printf("\n The character you have entered is %c",x);
	getch();
}


Strings:

In c programming:

alphabet: character.
word: string.
sentence: string.

String in C programming is array of characters.

int a[10];= In this case a is an array, which can hold 10 numbers or integers.

If i have take or deal with only 1 alphabet, how will i define it?
Ans: char x;

If i have to take or deal with word or sentence(which is multiple alphabet), how will i define it?

Suppose: I have take 5 letter word, how will i define it?
	char x[5];
Main point:
 10 number: int a[10];
 10 alphabet: char a[11];

int a[]={1,2,3,4,5}; //This is correct
In case of string:
char x[6]={'H','E','L','L','O',\0}; or    char x[]="HELLO";

Some questions:


char x='a';

char x[5]="KIST"; and char x[5]={'K','I','S','T','\0'};

Conclusion:

Character: char x; //declaration
	   char x='k'; //Initialization
	   format specifier: %c;

String:
	char x[10]; //declaration, where x can hold 9 characters.
	char x[5]="KIST"; 
	char x[]="KIST";
	char x[4]="KIST"; // This is incorrect, because, x can hold only 4 value where
			last value is null value, so it can store only 3 characters
	format specifier= %s;




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

   char greeting[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
   printf("Greeting message: %s\n", greeting );
   return 0;
}


or

#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
   int i=0;
   char greeting[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
   for(i=0;i<6;i++)
    {
       printf("%c",greeting[i]);  
     }
	
   return 0;
}


Drawback of %s:

%s is ok for single word.
%s is not ok for multiple words or sentence.


//WAP to ask user to input a sentence and count how many vowel and consonants are there and how many symbols are used?

example of sentence: 
  I am a good boy.

KIST;   char x[5]="KIST"; or char x[]="KIST" or char x[5]={'K','I','S','T','\0'};

I am a good boy.

char x[17]="I am a good boy."
char x[17]={'I',' ','a','m' and so on};


program:


#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
   char greeting[15];
  printf("Enter a word or a sentence");
  scanf("%s",&greeting);
  printf("The entered input is %s",greeting);
   return 0;
}

Output:
Enter a word or a sentence: KIST
The entered input is KIST.

2nd case:

Enter a word or a sentence: I eat rice.
The entered input is I.
which means, %s doesnt deal with space.


So main conclusion is dont use printf or scanf while you are dealing with word or
sentence. printf and scanf is ok for only a character using %c as format specifier.

What shall we use then for word or sentence?
: For word or sentence instead of using printf() and scanf(), use puts() or gets().

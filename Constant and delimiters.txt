Constant/Literals:
----------------------------------

Constant is the placeholder where the value remains constant or doesnt vary.

//Constant is a variable where value doesn't change.


	How to declare a constant?
Ans:
	THere are 2 ways:

	a. using "define" keyword.
	b. using "const"  keyword.



a. Using define:

	-> Define must be used always before void main().

	syntax:
		
	#define <constant name> <const value>


	for eg:

	#include<stdio.h>
	#define PI 3.14 
	
	void main()
	{
		
		printf("The value of PI is %3.f",PI)
		getch();
	}


b. Using const keyword:


-> Const keyword is always used inside void main where we declare our variables.


syntax:


 const <data type> <constant name>=<value>


eg:

	#include<Stdio.h>
	#include<conio.h>

	void main()
	{
		const int x=5;  //here x is a constant with value 5 in it which wont be changed.
		clrscr();
		x=x+1;
		printf("\n The new value of x is %d",x);
		getch();
	}

	: In above program there will be error on execution, since x is constant and in 3rd line we are
	   trying to change that value by adding 1. It won't work.


Constants values are never meant to be modified but access only.




Delimiters:
------------------------------


A delimiter is one or more characters that separate text strings. Common delimiters are commas (,), semicolon (;), quotes ( ", ' ), braces ({}), pipes (|), or slashes ( / \ ). 

printf("My name is \n deepak");


My name is
deepak
